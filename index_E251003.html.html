<h1>Introduction to Data Science||E251003</h1> <hr>
<h2>What is Data Science?</h2>
<p>Data Science is the field that combines <b>statistics</b>, 
<strong>programming</strong>, and 
<i>domain knowledge</i> to extract valuable insights from data. It is often considered the 
<mark>backbone of Artificial Intelligence</mark>. 
Without proper data analysis, organizations may make decisions based on <del>assumptions</del> rather than <u>facts</u>.
<hr></p><h3>Applications of Data Science:</h3><p> 
Some common applications include:<br>
1.<b>Healthcare</b> -Predicting diseases. <br>
2.<em>Finance</em> -Fraud detection. <br>
3.<strong>Marketing</strong> - Customer behavior analysis. <br>
4.<i>Technology</i> - Recommendation systems. </p>
<h4>Important Concepts</h4>
<p>
In Data Science, we often deal with mathematical notations such as H<sub>2</sub>O (data preprocessing), and calculating growth rates like 
2<sup>n</sup> (big data scalability).
